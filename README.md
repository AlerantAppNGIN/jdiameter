## Introduction

Mobicents jDiameter provides an Open Source Java implementation of the Diameter standard for Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA). Implementing the Base Protocol as well as some of the most important and widely used applications, Mobicents Diameter allows a fast development of IMS components, such as Application Server (AS), Home Subscriber Server (HSS), Call Session Control Function (CSCF), Subscriber Location Function (SLF), etc. Featuring an extensible architecture to provide support for new applications, as well as to adapt the core functionalities of the stack to a fully customized solution.
